For OOP section , I was practicing these topics -

- Pass by value: Pass a value in class and it pass only number or string.
- Pass by referance: : Pass a obj or location or address in a class and if it change anywhere then referance value is change everywhere.
- Method overloadding : Method name is same but parameters are different . when we don't know how the parameter is use in the method, then we use method overloadding. 
- Constructor overloadding : Same concept of method overloadding but it use for __init__ method (*num / num == None).
- Operator overloadding : When we change the built  In operator function , for example - by __add__ method we can add 2 number or concat 2 str , for obj add we need to change the __add__ function. 
- Encapsulation : Use encapsulation, when we change the variable access like private and public and using __variable_name(For private variable).
- Class variable : Class variable is  available everywhere and change is possible out of the class. It defines in the class and access any method of class. Call by className.variableName.
- Private variable : Private variable is changeable in the class only, it defines by __VariableName . Call by obj.variableName.
- Instance variable : Call by obj.variableName.
- Private method : _MethodName use for private method and this method only change in the class.
- Class Method, Static Method and Instance Method :
- Inheritance : Child class call the parent class And access all in parent class.
- Abstract class  and method: Abstract class contains one or more abstract methods. This methods are not implemented , jst only declared. Abstract methods must be implemented by its subclasses.
