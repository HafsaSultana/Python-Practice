For the OOP section, I practiced these topics -
- Pass by value: Pass a value in class and it passes only a number or string.
- Pass by reference: Pass an object location or address in a class and if it changes anywhere then the reference value is changed everywhere.
- Method overloading: The method name is the same but the parameters are different. when we don't know how the parameter is used in the method, then we use method overloading. 
- Constructor overloading: Same concept of method overloading but it is used for __init__ method (*num/num == None).
- Operator overloading: When we change the built-in operator function, for example - by __add__ method we can add 2 numbers or concat 2 str, for obj add we need to change the __add__ function. 
- Encapsulation: Use encapsulation, when we change the variable access to private and public and use __variable_name(For private variable).
- Class variable: Class variable is  available everywhere and change is possible out of the class. It defines the class and accesses any method of the class. Call by className.variableName.
- Private variable: Private variable is changeable in the class only, it is defined by __VariableName. Call by obj.variableName.
- Instance variable: Call by obj.variableName.
- Private method: _MethodName is used for private method and this method only changes in the class.
- Class Method, Static Method, and Instance Method :
- Inheritance: Child class calls the parent class And accesses all in parent class.
- Abstract class  and method: Abstract class contains one or more abstract methods. This method is not implemented, just only declared. Its subclasses must implement abstract methods.
